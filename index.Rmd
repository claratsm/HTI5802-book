# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the book for practical sections of [HTI5802: Algorithms in Bioinformatics and Genomics](). Most contents are demonstrated with PLINK and R programming language.

This book is designed as a collection of R Markdown notebooks, as supplementary to the lecture notes for GWAS and sequence interpretation of HTI5802 at PolyU.

1. [Genomewide association analysis (GWAS)](https://claratsm.github.io/HTI5802-book/genomewide-association-analysis-gwas.html) (2025-02-17)
2. [Variant interpretation for clinical sequencing]() (2025-03-10)

Note: Most contents may be updated before or right after the lectures, so please refer to the updated version.

GitHub Repository: you can find the source files on [claratsm/HTI5802-book](https://github.com/claratsm/HTI5802-book) and the way to re-build this book.
